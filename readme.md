# N-Body Simuation

## Description

In physics and astronomy, an N-body simulation is a simulation of a dynamical system of particles, usually under the influence of physical forces, such as gravity (see n-body problem for other applications). N-body simulations are widely used tools in astrophysics, from investigating the dynamics of few-body systems like the Earth-Moon-Sun system to understanding the evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. In physical cosmology, N-body simulations are used to study processes of non-linear structure formation such as galaxy filaments and galaxy halos from the influence of dark matter. Direct N-body simulations are used to study the dynamical evolution of star clusters.

## Installation

Install the required packages by doing "pip install -r requirements.txt".

## Usage

Start the main.py file to run the simulation. You can edit the parameters as you want.

## Contributing
### I would like to implement Barnesâ€“Hut algorithm or something like this to improve simulation performance.
